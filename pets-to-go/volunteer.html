      <p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in volunteering with Pets to Go. We are very grateful for your support. There are few things as rewarding as helping a homeless animal find a new home. When you volunteer at Pets to Go, you make a difference for homeless animals AND the people choosing to adopt them.</p>

<p>Volunteering can take a variety of forms. From serving as an ambassador spreading awareness in the community, to providing enrichment and socialization for an animal, to training other volunteers on how to support our mission, volunteer team members give their time and talent to change the lives of thousands of pets each year.</p>
