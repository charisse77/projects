     <h3 class="font-weight-lighter">Mission & Vision</h3>
      <p>Pets to Go is a non-profit no-kill rescue whose mission is to rescue, protect, and provide hope as we search for loving homes for stray and neglected animals. We promote animal welfare, strengthen the human-animal bond, and prevent the overpopulation of pets. We provide hope when they have given up hope, we speak when they cannot speak, and we love without boundaries.</p>

      <h3 class="font-weight-lighter">Pet Helpline</h3>
      <p>Pets To Go is dedicated to keeping pets out of shelters and rescues and helping them remain in homes with people who love them. This is why we have a Pet Helpline to assist pet owners who are struggling to resolve issues that could result in them leaving their pet at the shelter.</p>

<h3 class="font-weight-light">Adopt-a-Rama</h3>
<h6 class="font-weight-light">Saturday, January 9th 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m</h6>
<p>The Annual Adopt-a-Rama adoption event is free to attend. The only thing required of you is an open heart and a willingness to give a homeless pet a second chance. If you happen to meet your four-legged soulmate, we ask that you have a valid ID and be ready to pay the adoption fee. If you rent your home, a letter from your landlord giving you permission to have a pet will help ensure the adoption goes smoothly. </p>
